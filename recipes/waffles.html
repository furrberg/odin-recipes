        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Belgian waffles are similar to classic waffles, except that they have deeper pockets due to being made in a Belgian Waffle Maker.  Belgian waffles are also very light and airy inside.  Traditionally this was due to them being made with yeast.  Generally today they are made with baking powder, like in my recipe.  In order to keep the waffles light, we beat the egg whites separately from the yolks, then, fold them into the batter at the end.</p>
